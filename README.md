## 📘 Overview
DermaScan-AI is a **deep learning-based skin disease detection and classification system** that helps identify different types of skin conditions from medical images.  
Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model learns visual patterns from skin lesion datasets and predicts the most probable disease class with high accuracy.  
The goal is to assist dermatologists and healthcare professionals in **early diagnosis and faster decision-making**.
